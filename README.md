# RtlViewPager with TabLayout

A ViewPager that shows items from right to left for RTL locales and behaves like a regular ViewPager otherwise.



### How to import in Android Studio
The library is pushed to jCenter so you just need to add the following dependency to your ```build.gradle ```.
```
dependencies {
    compile 'com.dision.android:rtlviewpager:1.0.3'
}
```

For more info how to use it see in our [blog](http://blog.dision.co/2016/01/19/change-viewpager-swipe-direction-easily/)
